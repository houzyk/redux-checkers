  A simple checkers game implemented in React using Redux. The idea is to store the current state of the game in a redux state tree and to model each player action as a redux action.

You need node or npm/yarn to run this project.

Run `yarn install` to initialize any node packages including react and redux.
Run `yarn start` to start the project locally.
